# Changelog

#### 1.2.3.1 for KSP 1.1.2
* Revert persistence model to config file format and set save path to `GameData\KSEA\Historian\Plugins\PluginData`
* Fix: BUG - multiple layouts overlaying each other
* Fix: BUG - semi-transparent rectangle elements becoming increasingly opaque over multiple screenshots
* Fix: potential problem with configuration window id clashing with window ids from other mods.

#### 1.2.2.11 for KSP 1.1.2
* Change persistence model for configuration settings to use game save files rather than a config file in GameData. NOTE: Starting a new save will set configuration to default values. Reverting a flight or quickloading may load an older version of the configuration if you've made recent changes.

#### 1.2.1.14 for KSP 1.1.2
* Regression fix for `DateFormat` - same issue as with crew trait colouring

#### 1.2.1.9 for KSP 1.1.2
* Add text node parameters:
	* `VesselType` - the type of vessel e.g. probe, debris, lander etc.
	* `RealDate` - the real world date and time formatted using the block level DateFormat setting
* Support for Kerbal Konstructs](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/94863-112-kerbal-konstructs-v0967_ex-holy-glowing-balls-batman/) and [Kerbin Side](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/74776-112-kerbin-side-v110-supplements/)
	* `LaunchSite` modified to detect most recently set KK launch site
	* `KK-SpaceCenter` - the closest detected "space center"
	* `KK-Distance` - the straight line distance from the closest detected "space center"
* Setting added to main configuration dialog for "Default space center name". Will replace "KSC" in `LaunchSite` or `KK-SpaceCenter` parameter results. NOTE: only replaces the value if "KSC" is the full return value. "KSC Launch pad", "Kerbal Space Center" or similar results will NOT be affected
* `TEXT` and `SITUATION_TEXT` blocks can now specify a `Font` property for the name of the OS font to use to display the block. NOTE: font name must EXACTLY match OS font name. A utility parameter `ListFonts` is supplied to list the names of all installed fonts.
* "Historian.cfg" moved to `GameData\KSEA\Historian\Plugins` folder to avoid interfering with Module Manager caching.
* Current version number displayed in settings window title bar
* General code clean-up and refactoring

#### 1.1.7a
* Earth dates can be specified in two formats. "Normal" fixed length 365d year used by game engine or "KAC compatible" variable length years. If using variable length years, the in-game day 1 of a year may not be 1 January.
* Add text node parameters for date support:
  * DateKAC - formatted date calculated based on number of seconds (UT) since base start date. This date includes leap years.
  * YearKAC - the current year of the variable length date. At start and end of year may not match the Yx Dx display shown in game.
  * DayKAC - the current day of the variable length date. At start and end of year may not match the Yx Dx display shown in game. Some years will have 366 days.
  * MET - an alias for T+. The mission ellapsed time.
* Fix: MET was incorrectly calculated for periods > 1 day.
* Fix: MET always showed Kerbin based periods even when calendarmode is set to Earth.

#### 1.1.6a
* Add text node parameters:
  * Target - name of currently targeted vessel or body (if any)

  * LongitudeDMS (degrees, minutes, seconds) e,g 72째 12' 40" W
  * SrfSpeed - surface speed (same as Speed)
  * OrbSpeed - orbital speed
* `Longitude` and `LongitudeDMS` parameters always reports value between -180째 (W) and +180째 (E)
* Optional `BackgroundTexture` parameter for flag nodes. Allows adding a background texture to transparent flags. e.g. `BackgroundTexture = Squad/Flags/minimalistic` (simple "rippled" white flag background)
