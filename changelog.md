# Changelog

#### Dev build 1.2.8
* Refactor text parsing to move tokenizer into layout load rather than OnDraw should improve performance of layouts with large number of tags substantially with no penalty to simple layouts
* Add unit tests for text parser tokenizing and reconstituting
* Add initial support for parameterized tags (e.g. `Crew(Medics)`) - actual tags still to be implemented
* Add `TRAIT { Name Suffix Color }` block level node on TEXT element definition for specifying trait names, colours and abbreviations (to support for custom traits e.g. from USI MKS) - legacy PilotColor etc. still supported

__KNOWN ISSUES__
* Tokenized parsing not yet implemented for layout blocks inheriting from TEXT so they currently show blank

#### 1.2.7 for KSP 1.2.2
* Fix issue #10 where configuration dialog would not show correctly if settings.cfg file had to be created during start-up (e.g. after first installing mod and add action to Visual Studio build sequence to automatically delete settings.cfg so I don't overlook this breaking in the future
*  Add configuration option to allow setting text to be shown for empty crew slots i.e. in `pilot`, `scientist`, `engineer` (and short or list variants) tags when no crew of that type are present in vessel. *Default = None (same as previous version)*
* Add configuration option to allow setting text to be shown in `Crew`, `CrewShort` or `CrewList` tags for a vessel with no crew. *Default = unmanned (same as previous version)*.
* Fix #13 Out by one error when displaying Kerbin formatted dates.
* Modify text parsing routines to remove many temporary strings and to use cached stringbuilder if available. Should reduce garbage collection footprint.


#### 1.2.6
* Recompile for 1.2.1
* Update toolbar wrapper to latest version for compatibility with Contract Configurator
* Not tested against Kerbal Konstructs or KSCSwitcher as no 1.2 compatible versions exist at this time

#### 1.2.4.12 for KSP 1.1.2

#### 1.2.3.1 for KSP 1.1.2
* Revert persistence model to config file format and set save path to `GameData\KSEA\Historian\Plugins\PluginData`
* Fix: BUG - multiple layouts overlaying each other
* Fix: BUG - semi-transparent rectangle elements becoming increasingly opaque over multiple screenshots
* Fix: potential problem with configuration window id clashing with window ids from other mods.

#### 1.2.2.11 for KSP 1.1.2
* Change persistence model for configuration settings to use game save files rather than a config file in GameData. NOTE: Starting a new save will set configuration to default values. Reverting a flight or quickloading may load an older version of the configuration if you've made recent changes.

#### 1.2.1.14 for KSP 1.1.2
* Regression fix for `DateFormat` - same issue as with crew trait colouring

#### 1.2.1.9 for KSP 1.1.2
* Add text node parameters:
	* `VesselType` - the type of vessel e.g. probe, debris, lander etc.
	* `RealDate` - the real world date and time formatted using the block level DateFormat setting
* Support for Kerbal Konstructs](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/94863-112-kerbal-konstructs-v0967_ex-holy-glowing-balls-batman/) and [Kerbin Side](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/74776-112-kerbin-side-v110-supplements/)
	* `LaunchSite` modified to detect most recently set KK launch site
	* `KK-SpaceCenter` - the closest detected "space center"
	* `KK-Distance` - the straight line distance from the closest detected "space center"
* Setting added to main configuration dialog for "Default space center name". Will replace "KSC" in `LaunchSite` or `KK-SpaceCenter` parameter results. NOTE: only replaces the value if "KSC" is the full return value. "KSC Launch pad", "Kerbal Space Center" or similar results will NOT be affected
* `TEXT` and `SITUATION_TEXT` blocks can now specify a `Font` property for the name of the OS font to use to display the block. NOTE: font name must EXACTLY match OS font name. A utility parameter `ListFonts` is supplied to list the names of all installed fonts.
* "Historian.cfg" moved to `GameData\KSEA\Historian\Plugins` folder to avoid interfering with Module Manager caching.
* Current version number displayed in settings window title bar
* General code clean-up and refactoring

* Earth dates can be specified in two formats. "Normal" fixed length 365d year used by game engine or "KAC compatible" variable length years. If using variable length years, the in-game day 1 of a year may not be 1 January.
* Add text node parameters for date support:
  * DateKAC - formatted date calculated based on number of seconds (UT) since base start date. This date includes leap years.
  * YearKAC - the current year of the variable length date. At start and end of year may not match the Yx Dx display shown in game.
  * DayKAC - the current day of the variable length date. At start and end of year may not match the Yx Dx display shown in game. Some years will have 366 days.
  * MET - an alias for T+. The mission ellapsed time.
* Fix: MET was incorrectly calculated for periods > 1 day.
* Fix: MET always showed Kerbin based periods even when calendarmode is set to Earth.

  * SrfSpeed - surface speed (same as Speed)
  * OrbSpeed - orbital speed
* `Longitude` and `LongitudeDMS` parameters always reports value between -180째 (W) and +180째 (E)
* Optional `BackgroundTexture` parameter for flag nodes. Allows adding a background texture to transparent flags. e.g. `BackgroundTexture = Squad/Flags/minimalistic` (simple "rippled" white flag background)
