* Change persistence model for configuration settings to use game save files rather than a config file in GameData. NOTE: Starting a new save will set configuration to default values. Reverting a flight or quickloading may load an older version of the configuration if you've made recent changes.

* Regression fix for `DateFormat` - same issue as with crew trait colouring

#### 1.2.1.9 for KSP 1.1.2

* Support for Kerbal Konstructs](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/94863-112-kerbal-konstructs-v0967_ex-holy-glowing-balls-batman/) and [Kerbin Side](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/74776-112-kerbin-side-v110-supplements/)
	* `LaunchSite` modified to detect most recently set KK launch site
	* `KK-SpaceCenter` - the closest detected "space center"
	* `KK-Distance` - the straight line distance from the closest detected "space center"
* Setting added to main configuration dialog for "Default space center name". Will replace "KSC" in `LaunchSite` or `KK-SpaceCenter` parameter results. NOTE: only replaces the value if "KSC" is the full return value. "KSC Launch pad", "Kerbal Space Center" or similar results will NOT be affected
* `TEXT` and `SITUATION_TEXT` blocks can now specify a `Font` property for the name of the OS font to use to display the block. NOTE: font name must EXACTLY match OS font name. A utility parameter `ListFonts` is supplied to list the names of all installed fonts.

* Add text node parameters for date support:
  * DateKAC - formatted date calculated based on number of seconds (UT) since base start date. This date includes leap years.
  * YearKAC - the current year of the variable length date. At start and end of year may not match the Yx Dx display shown in game.
  * DayKAC - the current day of the variable length date. At start and end of year may not match the Yx Dx display shown in game. Some years will have 366 days.
  * MET - an alias for T+. The mission ellapsed time.

* Optional `BackgroundTexture` parameter for flag nodes. Allows adding a background texture to transparent flags. e.g. `BackgroundTexture = Squad/Flags/minimalistic` (simple "rippled" white flag background)
