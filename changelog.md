  * DateKAC - formatted date calculated based on number of seconds (UT) since base start date. This date includes leap years.
  * YearKAC - the current year of the variable length date. At start and end of year may not match the Yx Dx display shown in game.
  * DayKAC - the current day of the variable length date. At start and end of year may not match the Yx Dx display shown in game. Some years will have 366 days.
